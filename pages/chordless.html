          Chordless is a web application I developed for guitar players,
          specifically those who are at a begginer / intermediate level (Though
          it has it's applications for advanced players too).
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          I have been playing guitar for 5 years and as I look back one of the
          most frustrating things starting out was remembering the vast amount
          of chord names and even worse, their shapes. After learning the
          basics, I would find myself experimenting across the fretboard,
          creating sounds and progressions that sounded good to me. However,
          recording these turned out to be a nightmare. I would spend most of my
          time either A. recording the guitar as I played to then watch to
          remember the shapes or B. Drawing out what the shapes and chords
          looked like all up and down the fretboard down to the last note. I
          even tried memorizing tons of chord shapes and names so I could just
          write them out, but this became an issue when either A. new chords
          were introduced, or B. I played an abnormal shape that didn't map well
          to a common chord.

        <div class="paragraph">
          I was frustrated with this process, and felt I was limited because of
          it. It inspired me to create this app. You are presented with a full
          fretboard editor that looks just like your guitar! Simply click on the
          strings you play and it will not only save the exact visual of what
          you are playing but will also try to map it to a chord name! When you
          are done, you can view the entire song and effortlessly play!

        <div class="paragraph">
          On the technical side of things, the application uses React with
          TypeScript for the client side code, node.js for the api, and express
          for the middleware / server. The database is a SQL database called
          PostgreSQL.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          have experience developing personal projects in React JS and vanilla
          JS, but overall have has better experiences through internships and
          work experience using TypeScript, so I decided to go with this for the
          application. Overall, though I enjoy programming in both, I prefer
          TypeScript to JavaScript. Debugging is made more straightforward, the
          readability of the code is much improved, and I think it looks a lot
          more professional.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          For the backend, I still used JS as it just made it simpler for me
          personally. However, I would be open to look into implementing TS for
          the backend code as well. For the server, I used Express which has
          been pretty standard and reliable across all of my projects.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          As for the database, I had used MongoDB for the past few projects so I
          decided to get some experience with an SQL database. The Postgres DB
          was certainly strict in terms of how I queried and how I constructed
          tables and input data. It wasn't as simple as MongoDB which used json
          objects that could be directly loaded into the model and saved.
          However, tools like "Sequelize" helped tremendously in simplifying
          things. Overall, I would say I still prefer MongoDBs simplicty over
          Postgres, but I do think that for certain projects, structuring the
          database with a SQL database makes more sense. In my case, I think I
          could have gone either way. One major drawback to Postgres that I
          found was the availablity of a free hosting solution. With Mongo, you
          could host it on the cloud for free, but with Postgres I had to search
          for something that fit my need, and ultimately even the best options
          had serious drawbacks.

        <div class="section-heading">Deployment / Hosting</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          I found the best way (for starters) to deploy for a smaller app like
          mine was to use render.com. render.com is a great solution for
          developers who want to get there app deployed, but are not ready to
          commit to a serious (potentially expensive) hosting solution.
          onrender.com will host both a static website and web services for
          you... free of charge! Of course, with any free solution there is a
          catch! Lucky for us it is NOT one that requires us to spend money.
          However, you will notice in order to save resources they will not keep
          your web service up at all times if it has gone "idle" for a certain
          amount of time. This is annoying only because if you are the only user
          making api requests on the website, if you go idle for some time and
          try to the make a request, the web service might be have to restart
          thus resulting in a very annoying lag.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          Another issue is that render.com will give you a subdomain under
          "render.com" which is listed in the Public Suffix List (PSL). Due to
          this, sending cookies between your webservice / static site will NOT
          work. Luckily, render makes it easy for you to connect your own
          domain! A domain costs about $12 / year and I HIGHLY reccomend using
          Google Domains (which is what I used). They are simple and reliable
          and offer super straightforward DNS configuaration. You can simply
          purchase a domain you like for example "myexamplesite.xyz". Then,
          create two subdomains "app.myexamplesite.xyz" and
          "api.myexamplesite.xyz" connect them to their respective service and
          BAM - You can now send cookies between the two!
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          As for the database, I went with Neon's free tier. They offer up to
          100 hours / month of Active Time, which is the amount of wall-clock
          time the compute endpoints are open. Basically, the compute endpoints
          will open everytime you make query and stay open until no queries have
          been made for ~5 minutes. This is obviously not ideal. In the future,
          if I plan to market the application and gain a user base, I would
          definitely have to upgrade as 100 hours of open endpoints is only like
          4 days. For just personal use and sharing with family, friends, and
          friends-of-friends, this works just fine.

        <div class="section-heading">Wrapping Up</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Overall, this is one of my favorite projects. I am extremely satified
          with the result, and I also feel like I gained a ton of really good
          experience. I spent many, MANY hours figuring everything out and now
          feel like I have a really solid grasp on creating an application from
          start to finish. Not only this, I feel that I learned a ton from
          online resources, tutorials, and blogs when it came to best practices
          and terminology. I feel like this project really allowed me to fill in
          any knowdledge gaps I had from work. I plan to keep updating this
          project and adding features to it. I am also planning a v2 deployment
          which I will attempt to open the app up to users and include a mobile
          version. However, my full on development of the application has come
          to an end with the v1 release, and I look forward to new and exciting
          projects in the future!
