          The idea of predicting the stock market is an intriguing one. A model
          that could predict stock prices at a relatively high accuracy would
          prove to be an incredible asset to anyone. While there is still
          substantial risk and existing models are not to be fully relied upon,
          many have already reaped the benefits of such technology. Almost all
          major financial companies have adopted Machine Learning into their
          equity investment decisons and have benefited strongly from them.

          Several months ago, I decided to dive deeper into this topic and
          create my own project / tool.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          The project uses an artificial RNN called LSTM which stands for "Long
          short-term memory". Sounds pretty contradictory no? Well, when you
          look into the architecture of LSTM neural network, it kind of makes
          sense. RNN's in general have long term and short term memory
          abilities, and the name LSTM sort of plays off of this idea. LSTM
          networks are special because they address the long-term dependency
          problems true of typical RNNs. This Article from Towards Data Science
          written by Rian Dolphin does a good job of describing LSTM neural
          networks.

          This project is fairly simple and pretty much follows the standard
          procedure for an ML project. The data was retrieved from Yahoo and
          visualized. We then built our LSTM model:

        <div class="paragraph">
          Finally, we training the model with our training data and compared it
          to our test data for validation. Here's a visual of running the model
          for AAPL stock prices between 2017 and 2021:
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          In addition to the data processing and model, I also created a simple
          (admittedly kinda ugly) UI using PyQT. It takes in a start and end
          date as well as a stock symbol and will run the model for those
          parameters. You can watch the demo linked above.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          Overall, this project was super interesting and it was able to teach
          me how to use an LSTM RNN and prompted me to research the RNN further.
          I was suprised at how easy it was to retreive data from Yahoo and how
          clean the data was coming in. I plan to come back to this project to
          optimize / fine-tune the model and clean up some of the mistakes and
          sloppiness. My goal in the first iteration of this project was to
          really just get my feet wet.
